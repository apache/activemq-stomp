## Stomp Protocol

The Stomp project is the Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol site (or the Protocol Briefly Known as TTMP and Represented by the symbol :ttmp).

## Easy integration

Stomp is a very simple and easy to implement protocol, coming from the HTTP school of design; the server side may be hard to implement well, but it is very easy to write a client to get yourself connected. For example you can use Telnet to login to any Stomp broker and interact with it!

Many developers have told us that they have managed to write a Stomp client in a couple of hours to integrate their particular language, runtime or platform into the Stomp network.
