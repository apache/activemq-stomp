description:
  This skeleton of a webgen website provides a set of default files for every
  created webgen website.

  When using the standard settings, the sources are in the directory `src` and
  the generated output goes into `out`. Extensions can be placed under `ext`.

  For configuration purposes, use the config.yaml file.
---
Generating the site:

    webgen
    open out/index.html

Auto mode:

    rake auto
    
will run webgen in auto mode where it will auto-detect changes in the source files and 
regenerate the site automatically for you.


Cleaning up:

    rake clobber

Uploading the site:

    rake upload
	
Note: you should be sure that you have SSH_USER environment variable set.
